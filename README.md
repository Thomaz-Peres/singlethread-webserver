# Building a Single-Threaded Web Server

In this project, I will following the [Rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-01-single-threaded.html).


Here I'll write somethings I thing is useful/good/important, whatever

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We've choose the port `7878` for two reasons: HTTP isn't normally accepted on this port so our server in unlikely to conflict any other web server you might have running on your machine, and 7878 is `rust` typed on a telephone.


Sometimes, you'll see multiple messages printed for one browser request; the reason might be that the browser is making a request for the page as well as a request for other resources, like the *favicon.ico* icon that appears in the browser tab.

When `stream` goes out of scope and is dropped at the end of the loop, the connection is closed as part of the `drop` implementation.

## Reading the request (not is the final)

Receiving the result, looks like this:

(Depending on your browser, you might get slightly different output)

```
Request: [
    "GET / HTTP/1.1",
    "Host: localhost:7878",
    "Connection: keep-alive",
    "Cache-Control: max-age=0",
    "sec-ch-ua: \"Not A(Brand\";v=\"99\", \"Microsoft Edge\";v=\"121\", \"Chromium\";v=\"121\"",
    "sec-ch-ua-mobile: ?0",
    "sec-ch-ua-platform: \"Windows\"",
    "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1",
    "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/121.0.0.0 Safari/537.36 Edg/121.0.0.0",
    "Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7",
    "Sec-Fetch-Site: none",
    "Sec-Fetch-Mode: navigate",
    "Sec-Fetch-User: ?1",
    "Sec-Fetch-Dest: document",
    "Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br",
    "Accept-Language: pt-BR,pt;q=0.9,en;q=0.8,en-GB;q=0.7,en-US;q=0.6",
]
```

## A Closer Look at an HTTP Request

HTTP is a text-based protocol, and a request takes this format:

```
Method Request-URI HTTP-Version CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
```

The first line is the request line that holds information about what the client is requesting. The first part of the request line indicates the method being used, such as GET or POST, which describes how the client is making this request. Our client used a GET request, which means it is asking for information.

The next part of the request line is /, which indicates the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) the client is requesting: a URI is almost, but not quite, the same as a Uniform Resource Locator (URL). The difference between URIs and URLs isnâ€™t important for our purposes in this chapter, but the HTTP spec uses the term URI, so we can just mentally substitute URL for URI here.

The last part is the HTTP version the client uses, and then the request line ends in a CRLF sequence. (CRLF stands for carriage return and line feed, which are terms from the typewriter days!) The CRLF sequence can also be written as \r\n, where \r is a carriage return and \n is a line feed. The CRLF sequence separates the request line from the rest of the request data. Note that when the CRLF is printed, we see a new line start rather than \r\n.

Looking at the request line data we received from running our program so far, we see that GET is the method, / is the request URI, and HTTP/1.1 is the version.

Try making a request from a different browser or asking for a different address, such as 127.0.0.1:7878/test, to see how the request data changes.

## Writing a response.

Responses have the following format:

```
HTTP-Version Status-Code Reason-Phrase CRLF
headers CRLF
message-body
```

reason phrase provides a text description of the status code. After the CRLF sequence are any headers, another CRLF sequence, and the body of the response.

Here is an example response that uses HTTP version 1.1, has a status code of 200, an OK reason phrase, no headers, and no body:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
```
